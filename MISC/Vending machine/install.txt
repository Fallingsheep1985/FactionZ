Hi all! Thought I would share a simple little script I put together. I am by no means a professional and this probably could be cleaner and better written but it works and is a cool little addition. This script is also a simple example of what can be accomplished with your server. Start with small scripting projects and have fun learning. So here it is. I studied the code from a few others and threw this together..
 
Add this code to your fn_selfactions.sqf at the very bottom...
//------------------------------------------------ Vending Machine --------------------------------//
private["_playerPos","_nearVend"];

_playerPos = getPosATL player;
_nearVend = count nearestObjects [_playerPos, ["MAP_vending_machine"], 4] > 0;
 
if (_nearVend) then {
        if (s_player_buySoda < 0) then {
            s_player_buySoda = player addaction[("<t color=""#00C732"">" + ("Buy Soda") +"</t>"),"Vending\venddrink.sqf"];
        };
    } else {
        player removeAction s_player_buySoda;
        s_player_buySoda = -1;
    };
 
//--------------------------------------------- Vending Machine End ---------------------------//
Make a folder in your root of your mission file called "Vending" and make a empty file named "venddrink.sqf", then copy and paste this...
//by ZeroK00L
private["_playerPos","_canVend"];

call gear_ui_init;
_playerPos = getPosATL player;
_canVend = count nearestObjects [_playerPos, ["MAP_vending_machine"], 4] > 0;
_soda = ["ItemSodaRabbit","ItemSodaOrangeSherbet","ItemSodaLvg","ItemSodaClays","ItemSodaSmasht","ItemSodaPepsi","ItemSodaMdew","ItemSodaCoke","ItemSodaLemonade"];

if (_canVend) then {
			
			playsound "vendingmachine";
			sleep 2;
			player playActionNow "PutDown";
			player addMagazine 'ItemSodaRabbit';
			cutText ["You received a Soda from the Vending Machine!", "PLAIN DOWN"];
};
OPTIONAL IF YOU WANT THE SOUND!
 
Open up description.ext and add this to your sounds class. If you dont already have one you can make one..
class CfgSounds
{
    sounds[] ={vendingmachine};
 
class vendingmachine
    {
    name="vendingmachine";
    sound[]={\Vending\vendingmachine.ogg,0.9,1};
    titles[] = {};
    };
	
};
Then add the attached sound file to your "Vending" folder. Voila!
 
If you notice, in the venddrink.sqf I put an array for all the sodas & beer the game can use.
_soda = ["ItemSodaRabbit","ItemSodaOrangeSherbet","ItemSodaLvg","ItemSodaClays","ItemSodaSmasht","ItemSodaPepsi","ItemSodaMdew","ItemSodaCoke","ItemSodaLemonade"];
Maybe if I have time I will create a random chance for different sodas to come out. Also I might make it so it takes money from the player. If anyone wants to tackle those items and share please do. Have fun with it :) This script can even be modified and used on the Refrigerators to give the player canned foods.
 
P.S You will need to place a vending machine somewhere on the map. Classname is "MAP_vending_machine". I have tried to use Raymix's Emerald tools but the script doesn't recognize the vending machine placed by that tool. Would be cool if it did...so use the editor for now. :)
