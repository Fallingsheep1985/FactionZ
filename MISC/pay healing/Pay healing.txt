Lets start install it:

1. Open fnSelfaction and paste this code above " //Allow owner to pack vault ". So it must be like that:
 
	if(_typeOfCursorTarget in Fast_Med  and (player distance _cursorTarget < 3)) then {		
		if (s_fast_med_dialog1 < 0) then {
			s_fast_med_dialog1 = player addAction ["<t color='#0059FF'>Pay for treatment</t>", "Scripts\Medical\FastMed.sqf",_cursorTarget, 3, true, true, "", ""];
		};
	} else {		
		player removeAction s_fast_med_dialog1;
		s_fast_med_dialog1 = -1;
	};	
	
//Allow owner to pack vault
2. Find 
	player removeAction s_bank_dialog;
	s_bank_dialog = -1;
	player removeAction s_bank_dialog2;
	s_bank_dialog2 = -1;
and place under them that code:
 
	player removeAction s_fast_med_dialog1;
	s_fast_med_dialog1 = -1;
3.Open variables.sqf and add this code after "disableSerialization;":
 
Fast_Med = ["NPC1","NPC1","NPC1"];
For instance 11 Cherna:
Fast_Med = ["Dr_Annie_Baker_EP1","Doctor","Dr_Hladik_EP1"];
4. Find:
dayz_resetSelfActions = {
and paste under this code:
 
	s_fast_med_dialog1 = -1;
5.Extract RAR archive and place scripts folder in your mission folder.
6. Change cost for treatment in FastMed.sqf 
7. Change NPCs in variables.sqf

8. Congratulations! Well done! Pew pew pew!


In future gonna make checking of player needs.
For example, player has only bleeding. So cost of healing will be = bandageCost * Tax. So u dont need to pay all cost for feeding or antibiotics.
